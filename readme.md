## Get started
You can either create a `SveveClient` directly:
```cs
var client = new SveveClient(new SveveClientOptions
{
    Username = "MyCompanyUsername",
    Password = "super_secret_password";
});
```
or using the `IServiceCollection` extension:
```cs
services.AddSveveClient(new SveveClientOptions { ... });
```
Using the extension method registers a `SveveClient`, `SveveSmsClient`, `SveveGroupClient`, `SveveAdminClient` and the `SveveClientOptions`.  
All clients are registered as singletons.  

## Send a SMS
```cs
// Send SMS to a single phone number
await client.Sms.SendAsync("98765432", "The actual content of the SMS");

// Send SMS to two spesific phone numbers
await client.Sms.SendAsync("98765432,90876543", "Drink water!");

// Send SMS to a named group
await client.Sms.SendAsync("people-who-dont-drink-enough-water", "Drink more water!");
```
To manage the named groups, see [receiver groups](#manage-recipient-groups)  
  
`SveveSmsClient.SendAsync` returns a list of `SmsResult`-objects which contains information about the sending of each individual sms.  
If you only intend to send the SMS to a single receiver, you could use:
```cs
var messageId = await client.Sms.SendSingleAsync("98765432", "The actual content of the SMS");
```
`SendSingleAsync` throws if sending fails and returns the message-id from Sveve directly.

## SMS Options
When sending a SMS, you can pass a `SmsOptions`-object to alter how the SMS is sent.
```cs
var options = new SmsOptions
{
    ...
}
await client.Sms.SendAsync("98765432", "Some text message...", options);
```

### Custom sender
To specify the sender, add a `Sender` property to either the `SveveClientOptions`:
```cs
var client = new SveveClient(new SveveClientOptions
{
    Sender = "My company"
    
    // other properties ...
});
```
or to the `SmsOptions` itself:
```cs
var options = new SmsOptions
{
    Sender = "My company"
};
```

If `Sender` is specified in both `SveveClientOptions` and `SmsOptions`, `SmsOptions.Sender` is used.  
When a receiver sees your message, the `Sender` will be used as a display name.

### Repeat a SMS
The `SmsOptions.Repeat` property can be used to configure repetition of a SMS:
```cs
var options = new SmsOptions();

// Repeat message every 2 days until message has been sent three times
options.Repeat = SmsRepetition
    .Daily(days: 2)
    .EndsAfter(repeatedCount: 3);

// Repeat message once a week for two months.
options.Repeat = SmsRepetition
    .Weekly()
    .EndsOn(DateTime.Today.AddMonths(2));
```
See the `SmsRepetition` class for more.

### Schedule a SMS
The `SmsOptions.ScheduledSendTime` configures when the message will be sent.  
If the provided `DateTimeOffset` is earlier than now, it is ignored.

```cs
await client.Sms.SendAsync("vip-customers", "Use promocode vip123 for special offer", new SmsOptions
{
    ScheduledSendTime = vipPromo.StartDate.AddDays(-1)
});
```

### Replies
If `SmsOptions.IsReplyAllowed` is `true`, then the recipient of the SMS can reply.  
For this to work, Sveve ignores `SmsOptions.Sender` and instead uses a 14-digit autogenerated phone number as the sender.
```cs
await client.Sms.SendAsync("12345678", "Do you want special offers? Reply YES for a chance to win a VIP-membership.", new SmsOptions
{
    IsReplyAllowed = true
});
```

Use `SmsOptions.ReplyMessageId` to keep additional messages on the same thread as the referenced message.  
```cs
var messageId = await client.Sms.SendSingleAsync("12345678", "Do you want special offers? Reply YES for a chance to win a VIP-membership.", new SmsOptions
{
    IsReplyAllowed = true
})

await client.Sms.SendAsync("12345678", "Oh, and by the way! We have super VIP deals right now!", new SmsOptions
{
    ReplyMessageId = messageId
});

// Some time passes, and our distinguished customer eventuelly replies:
// Customer: YES
// Somehow, this magical unnamed customer wins and receives a VIP membership.

await client.Sms.SendAsync("12345678", "Congrats! You are now a VIP member!", new SmsOptions
{
    ReplyMessageId = messageId
});
```

### Test a message
To test sending messages, add `IsTest=true` to either `SveveClientOptions` or `SmsOptions`.  
If `SveveClientOptions.IsTest` is `true`, all messages will be sent as test messages regardless of the `SmsOptions.IsTest` value.

## Manage recipient groups
Groups can be a useful way to reach large amounts of people with the same SMS.  
**Note:** You will be charged for each individual SMS.

A group is created either by explicitly calling
```cs
await client.Group.CreateAsync("my-group");
```
or by adding the first receiver
```cs
await client.Group.AddRecipientAsync("my-group", "Some Person", "12345678");
```

You can now send an sms to every member of a group by calling the normal send methods with the group name as the recipient.
```cs
await client.Sms.SendAsync("my-group", "Super-sale! Only on monday!")
```

Once you are done using the group, it can be deleted by calling
```cs
await client.Group.DeleteAsync("my-group");
```

## Manage account
Request more SMS units
```cs
// Order 500 additional SMS units.
await client.Admin.OrderSmsAsync(SmsOrderSize.Bulk500);
```

Check remaining SMS units
```cs
var smsCount = await client.Admin.RemainingSmsAsync();
if (smsCount < 500)
{
    // Do stuff if less than 500
    // remaining SMS units.
}
```

# Notifications from Sveve
Sveve can send you delivery reports and notify you of incoming messages if you have an API.  
Install the `Sveve.AspNetCore` NuGet package.

Before you can receive any notifications:
In `Program.cs` where you map your endpoints, make sure to also map the sveve consumer endpoint:
```cs
app.MapSveveConsumerEndpoint("/api/sveve");
```
You can choose the path yourself.
Once you're done, copy the full URL to your Sveve endpoint and navigate to the [Sveve control panel](https://sveve.no/v2/api/innstillinger).
Paste the full URL path into `Leveringsrapport` to receive delivery reports and into `Videresend svar på meldinger` to receive incoming messages.

## Delivery reports
Delivery reports tells you if a SMS sent from your Sveve account was delivered or why it failed.  
To consume delivery reports, first make a consumer class:
```cs
public class DeliveryReportConsumer(ILogger log) : ISveveDeliveryReportConsumer
{
    public Task SmsDelivered(
        OutgoingSms sms, 
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Sms was delivered.
        // If you set the SmsOptions.Reference when sending, 
        // you can access that reference now:
        log.LogInformation("SMS {sms_reference} delivered!", sms.Reference);
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
    
    public Task SmsFailed(
        OutgoingSms sms,
        SmsDeliveryError error,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // SMS was not delivered.
        log.LogInformation(
	        "SMS {sms_reference} failed because {error_message}",
	        sms.Reference, error.Description);
	    return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

The consumer is registered by calling
```cs
services.AddSveveDeliveryConsumer<DeliveryReportConsumer>();
```

## Incoming messages
Make a class implementing `ISveveSmsConsumer`
```cs
public class SmsConsumer(GptAi gpt, SveveSmsClient sveve) : ISveveSmsConsumer
{
	public async Task SmsReceived(
		IncomingSmsReply sms, 
		CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	{
		var joke = await gpt.PromptAsync(
			"You are a very funny comedian who loves the audience." +
			"Make a joke about this: " + sms.Message);
			
		sveve.SendAsync(sms.SenderPhoneNumber, "Joke: " + joke);
	}
	
	public Task SmsReceived(
		IncomingSmsToCode sms,
		CancellationToken cancellationToken)
		=> Task.CompletedTask;
	
	public Task SmsReceived(
		IncomingSmsToDedicatedPhoneNumber sms,
		CancellationToken cancellationToken)
		=> Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

and register it like this:
```cs
services.AddSveveSmsConsumer<SmsConsumer>();
```

For both delivery report consumers and sms consumers, you can register as many consumers as you like. They will be called one at a time in the order they were registered.
